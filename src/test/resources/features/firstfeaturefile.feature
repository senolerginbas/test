#All feature files must start with Feature keyword. There can be ONLY 1 Feature keyword per file.
#  Feature describes the overall test cases.
#  It can be the user story name
#  Google_Search_Functionality
# Google Search Functionality
@google_search
Feature: Google_Search_Functionality
#  Scenario = Test Case
#  Under Scenario, we will have TEST STEPS
#  Given, And, Then, When, But, * annotations
#  These are Gherkin language
#  EACH STEP MUST START WITH A GHERKEN KEYWORD
#  Given should be used as preconditions
#  Then should be used for verifications
#  And and When should be used in hhe middle steps
  Background: user_is_on_the_google_page
#  Background keyword is used before each Scenario keyword
#  Background is used for repeated pre conditions.
#  It cannot be used after Scenario keyword, so use it first
    Given user is on the google page
  @iphone_search
  Scenario: TC01_iphone_search

#What is a feature file?
#We write our test scenarios in feature files.
#We use Gherkin language in the feature files such as Feature, Scenario, Given, And, Then, When, But, Background,...
#It is written in plain English
#Known as non technical part. Everybody can read and understand
#What is a step definition?
#We write our Java code in the step definitions
#This has the technical part.Only technical people can understand

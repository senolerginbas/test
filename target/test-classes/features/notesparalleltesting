1.We add 3 plugins in the pom
-failsafe : letting the tests execute safe even after some test fails
-surefire : for parallel execution. We use parallel and threadCount keywords in this plugin
-cucumber-reporting : this generated extra detailed reports.
2.Create multiple runner
We create these runner for parallel execution
Normally we run our Runner class that we created before
-TestRunner
-SmokeTestRunner
-RegressionTestRunner
3.Run from the Terminal while you are in the project directory
-mvn clean verify
-mvn clean install
